# ACRS (Anti-Collusion Reputation System)
ACRS is a reputation logic that prevents collusion, enabling transparency and integrity of governance and incentivization. We use the [Girvan-Newman Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girvan%E2%80%93Newman_algorithm) to compute shortest-path betweenness centrality for nodes, which in turn detects the collusion among the nodes.


## Main Track
#### Robust Democracy. <br/>
Identity is not a given in Web3 due to a decentralized nature of blockchain that preserves privacy and anonymity. Therefore, within the context of Web3, on-chain reputation acts as a mechanism to detect oneâ€™s credibility and accountability. For instance, on-chain reputation allows to check the legitimacy of a certain party, classify and incentivize contribution, foster governance and delegation, and prevent spam and sybil attacks.

The main problem we solve is collusion, which hinders the value of on-chain reputation. Collusion could create disproportionate and centralized influence that could incur undeserved authority, underserved provision of incentives, monopolization of public fund, and absence of censorship resistance.


## Sponsor Track

### Scroll Track
#### Use L1SLOAD and Deploy on Scroll
L1SLOAD contracts <br>
L1 (Sepplia): https://github.com/BigaChad314/EthTokyo/blob/main/contracts/ReputationSystems.sol <br>
L2 (Scroll DEV network): https://github.com/BigaChad314/EthTokyo/blob/main/contracts/l1sload.sol <br>
We fetch the `reputationScore` mapping variable data from the L1 contract to Scroll L2 using L1SLOAD. <br><br>
Scroll DEV network Blockscouter: <br>
https://l1sload-blockscout.scroll.io/address/0xb8490f653dABC40DE7C0d7Dd57d2CD1511D89Bd0 <br>
We tried to verify the contract, but it was a bit tricky, so instead, we are attaching the transaction record. <br>

### ENS Track
We used ENS when assigning reputation scores to other nodes. Additionally, we display the reputation system graph using ENS. You can check it [here](https://github.com/BigaChad314/EthTokyo/blob/main/client/frontend/vite-project/src/components/Graph.tsx). More examples can be found within the repository.
