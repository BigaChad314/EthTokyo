# ACRS (Anti-Collusion Reputation System)
ACRS is a reputation logic that prevents collusion, enabling transparency and integrity of governance and incentivization. We use the [Girvan-Newman Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girvan%E2%80%93Newman_algorithm) to compute shortest-path betweenness centrality for nodes, which in turn detects the collusion among the nodes.


## Main Track
#### Robust Democracy. <br/>
Identity is not a given in Web3 due to a decentralized nature of blockchain that preserves privacy and anonymity. Therefore, within the context of Web3, on-chain reputation acts as a mechanism to detect oneâ€™s credibility and accountability. For instance, on-chain reputation allows to check the legitimacy of a certain party, classify and incentivize contribution, foster governance and delegation, and prevent spam and sybil attacks.

The main problem we solve is collusion, which hinders the value of on-chain reputation. Collusion could create disproportionate and centralized influence that could incur undeserved authority, underserved provision of incentives, monopolization of public fund, and absence of censorship resistance.
